# Teailee 

## Technologies
Trailee is an opensource Android-App built in Kotlin.
For the computer vision aspect of this project we decided to use [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)

## Inspiration
The main inspiration for us to attempt to solve this challenge was the opportunity to emerge ourselves in a new technology.
Diving into computer vision in a 36-hour Hackathon seemed like a refreshing thing to do whilst also cater to a real world need.

## Challenges

### Other solution approaches
####  Perspective Warping
One of the many things we tried was to use perspective warping in an attempt to correct for lenses distortions.
This ended up (and looking back quiet obviously so) distorting the surroundings of the track to a point where it would not have been feasible for the real world application of this product.


## Possible future improvements
- Import of different train models
- Fine tune image preprocessing to increase accuracy of train-track
